# tlsguard

The goal of the TLSGUARD project is to implement in the GO Programming language a set of programs to manage TLS ciphers. For instance it should be possible to validate the use of strong and weak ciphers, to query if particular ciphers are in the NIST approved cipher list, some information about the cipher itself etc.
